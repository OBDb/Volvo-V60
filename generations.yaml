    description: "The first-generation Volvo V60 was introduced as a sporty, lifestyle-oriented wagon alternative to the more practical V70, sharing its platform and most components with the S60 sedan. Built on Ford's EUCD platform (later owned by Geely after their acquisition of Volvo), it featured a dynamic silhouette with a dramatically sloping roofline and an emphasis on style over maximum cargo capacity. Engine options varied by market but included various four, five, and six-cylinder petrol and diesel engines, with power outputs ranging from approximately 115 to 350 horsepower in the high-performance Polestar models. The interior showcased Volvo's Scandinavian design philosophy with a floating center console, high-quality materials, and intuitive controls. This generation pioneered several safety innovations, including Pedestrian Detection with full auto brake, City Safety collision avoidance, and various driver assistance systems. A facelift in 2014 refreshed the styling and updated the technology, while a more significant update in 2016 introduced new Drive-E four-cylinder engines focused on efficiency and included a plug-in hybrid variant. The first-generation V60 successfully repositioned Volvo's wagon offerings with a more emotional, design-focused approach while maintaining the brand's core values of safety and practicality."

    description: "The second-generation V60 represents Volvo's thoroughly modern take on the premium mid-size wagon, built on the company's Scalable Product Architecture (SPA) shared with the S60, XC60, and larger 90-series models. The exterior design features clean, minimalist lines with distinctive Thor's Hammer LED headlights and more balanced proportions than its predecessor, offering increased interior space despite maintaining a sporty silhouette. A significant departure from the previous generation is the exclusive use of four-cylinder engines across the range, with various levels of electrification. Options include turbocharged T5, turbo- and supercharged T6, and plug-in hybrid T8 twin-engine variants with the latter producing over 400 horsepower in Polestar Engineered form. The interior exemplifies Scandinavian luxury with premium materials, a tablet-style Sensus (later Google-based) infotainment system, and minimal physical buttons. The more rugged Cross Country variant offers increased ground clearance, standard all-wheel drive, and body cladding for light off-road capability. Safety and driver assistance technology reached new heights with Pilot Assist semi-autonomous driving capabilities, cross-traffic alert with autobrake, and numerous other advanced features. The second-generation V60 has further refined Volvo's unique position in the market, offering distinctive design, progressive electrification technology, and class-leading safety in the increasingly niche premium wagon segment."
