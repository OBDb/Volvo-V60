    description: "The first-generation Volvo V60 was introduced in autumn 2010 as a sporty, lifestyle-oriented wagon alternative to the more practical V70, sharing its platform and most components with the S60 sedan. Built on Ford's EUCD platform (later owned by Geely after their acquisition of Volvo), it featured a dynamic silhouette with a dramatically sloping roofline and an emphasis on style over maximum cargo capacity. Engine options varied by market but included various four, five, and six-cylinder petrol and diesel engines, with power outputs ranging from approximately 115 to 350 horsepower in the high-performance Polestar models. The interior showcased Volvo's Scandinavian design philosophy with a floating center console, high-quality materials, and intuitive controls. This generation pioneered several safety innovations, including Pedestrian Detection with full auto brake, City Safety collision avoidance, and various driver assistance systems. The V60 was available in various trim levels including R-Design for a sportier appearance and Ocean Race Edition with unique detailing."

  - name: "First Generation (Facelift)"
    start_year: 2014
    end_year: 2018
    description: "The facelifted first-generation Volvo V60 was introduced in 2014 with refreshed styling, updated technology, and an emphasis on efficiency. The exterior received revised front and rear bumpers, updated headlights, and new alloy wheel designs. A more significant update in 2016 introduced Volvo's new Drive-E four-cylinder engine family, replacing the older five and six-cylinder engines while improving fuel efficiency and reducing emissions. The plug-in hybrid variant (V60 Plug-in Hybrid/D6) was introduced, combining a five-cylinder diesel engine with an electric motor to achieve exceptional fuel economy and low CO2 emissions. The V60 Polestar performance variant received updates including a new four-cylinder turbo engine in 2016. The Cross Country variant was introduced in 2015 with increased ground clearance and standard all-wheel drive. This facelifted generation maintained Volvo's position as a leader in safety technology while offering progressive electrification options in the premium wagon segment."

  - name: "Second Generation"

    end_year: null
    description: "The second-generation Volvo V60 represents Volvo's thoroughly modern take on the premium mid-size wagon, built on the company's Scalable Product Architecture (SPA) shared with the S60, XC60, and larger 90-series models. The exterior design features clean, minimalist lines with distinctive Thor's Hammer LED headlights and more balanced proportions than its predecessor, offering increased interior space despite maintaining a sporty silhouette. A significant departure from the previous generation is the exclusive use of four-cylinder engines across the range, with various levels of electrification. Options include turbocharged B3/B4/B5 mild hybrid variants, turbo- and supercharged T6, and plug-in hybrid T8 twin-engine variants with the latter producing over 400 horsepower in Polestar Engineered form. The interior exemplifies Scandinavian luxury with premium materials, a tablet-style Sensus infotainment system (later Google-based), and minimal physical buttons. The more rugged Cross Country variant offers increased ground clearance, standard all-wheel drive, and body cladding for light off-road capability. Safety and driver assistance technology reached new heights with Pilot Assist semi-autonomous driving capabilities, cross-traffic alert with autobrake, and numerous other advanced features. The second-generation V60 has further refined Volvo's unique position in the market, offering distinctive design, progressive electrification technology, and class-leading safety in the increasingly niche premium wagon segment."
